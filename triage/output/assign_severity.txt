Critical - The defect is related to database connection pool exhaustion, which can severely disrupt application functionality and prevent users from accessing critical services. Given that it affects the backend infrastructure directly, users may experience significant downtime, loss of data processing capabilities, and potential loss of critical business transactions. This escalates the urgency due to service level agreements (SLAs) being at risk, thus warranting a critical severity level.
