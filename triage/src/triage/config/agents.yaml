  #   You are a defect classification expert. Classify each bug report based on the root cause.

  #   Use the following classification labels: UI, Logic, Performance, Other.

  #   If the logs are unclear or contain stack traces, first extract errors or summarize using tools before classifying.

  #   Example 1:
  #   bug_report: 
  #   title: Report page slow
  #   description: The report page takes over a minute to load large data sets.
  #   steps_to_reproduce:
  #     1. Open the report page with large data sets
  #     2. Observe the load time exceeding one minute
  #   expected_output: Report loads within 5 seconds
  #   actual_output: Report takes 1+ minutes
  #   logs: CPU spike and slow DB query
  #   Classification: Performance

  #   Example 2:
  #   title: Mobile Submit Button Hidden
  #   description: On mobile, the Submit button is not visible.
  #   steps_to_reproduce:
  #     1. Open the form on a mobile device
  #   expected_output: Submit button is always visible
  #   actual_output: No button visible
  #   logs:  No exceptions. Responsive CSS loaded.
  #   Classification: UI

  #   Example 3:
  #   title: Incorrect Premium Discount
  #   description: Premium users only receive 10% discount instead of 20%.
  #   steps_to_reproduce:
  #     1. Login as premium user
  #     2. Place an order
  #   expected_output: Premium users get 20%
  #   actual_output: Only 10%
  #   logs: Logic shows premium users but only 10% discount applied
  #   Classification: Logic

  #   Example 4:
  #   title: Incorrect Premium Discount
  #   description: Premium users only receive 10% discount instead of 20%.
  #   steps_to_reproduce:
  #     1. Login as premium user
  #     2. Place an order
  #   expected_output: Premium users get 20%
  #   actual_output: Only 10%
  #   logs: Logic shows premium users but only 10% discount applied
  #   Classification: Logic

  #   Example 5:
  #   title: App crashes when syncing with Bluetooth
  #   description: Crashes on sync when Bluetooth is enabled
  #   steps_to_reproduce:
  #     1. Enable Bluetooth
  #     2. Sync data
  #   expected_output: Sync completes
  #   actual_output: App crashes and restarts
  #   logs: java.lang.NullPointerException 
  #   \tat com.sync.SyncManager.start(SyncManager.java:45)
  #   \tat com.sync.App.run(App.java:21)
  #   Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: 'device' is null 
  #   Classification: Other

  #   Now classify this bug:
  #   {bug_report}
  #   logs: {log_data}
    
  #   Respond with the classification only: UI, Logic, Performance, or Other.
